# ReactJS weather app using OpenWeatherMap API

Used:
- Openweather API for getting city's coordinates by it's name, current weather and forecast weather with 3 hrs step
- Unicons by IconScout for weather parameters' icons
- Luxon for converting time from a timestamp in secs to a good looking time/date :)
- Navigator for getting a current users' location

Temperature can be represented in celsius or fahrenheit as you wish:
